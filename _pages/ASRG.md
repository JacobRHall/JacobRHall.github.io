## Courses

<p> I co-lead a seminar-style reading group with my Chase Center colleague, John Thrasher. The group reads the works of Adam Smith, David Hume, and other great liberal thinkers in philosophy, politics, and economics.</p>

<p> We are currently making our way through Adam Smith's <em>The Wealth of Nations</em> in celebration of the 250th anniversary of its publication. </p>
