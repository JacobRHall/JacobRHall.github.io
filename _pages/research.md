## Working Papers

  <summary>Itinerant Kings</summary>
  <p> Abstract: Rather than govern from a fixed capital, medieval European kings were itinerant. I argue that itinerant kingship was a rational coalition-building strategy employed by relatively weak rulers in the face of potentially violent elites. To empirically explore itinerant kingship, I introduce data on the daily location of the English king from 1199 to 1547. Utilizing genealogical data for feudal barons, I show that the king's itinerary targeted “key players” within the elite network to maintain political support. When the Early Modern “military revolution” increased the military power of the king vis-à-vis the elites, European kings adopted stationary governments. </p>

  <summary>Magna Carta</summary>
  <p>(with <a href="https://mason.gmu.edu/~mkoyama2/About.html">Mark Koyama</a> and <a href="https://desireedesierto.com">Desiree Desierto</a>)</p>
  <p> Abstract: Magna Carta, a pivotal moment in history, institutionalized constraints on royal power. As an ideal, Magna Carta prescribes an ‘inclusive’ power-sharing arrangement in which the ruler (king) has limited power and elites (barons) have equal rights. It was forged in a feudal environment and fought between a coalition of the king’s loyal barons and a coalition of rebel barons. We derive conditions under which Magna Carta occurs in equilibrium: when the king is extractive; when the initial distribution of power among barons is egalitarian; and when barons have large resources that cannot be easily appropriated by the king. Under these conditions, even the most powerful baron would be willing to change the status quo by leading a rebel coalition to fight for Magna Carta. To provide empirical support, we build a unique dataset of the universe of English barons, their family networks, and their baronies and resources between 1200-1270. </p>

  <summary>Railroads and American Institutional Change</summary>
  <p>(with <a href="https://slademendenhall.com">Slade Mendenhall</a>)</p>
  <p> Abstract: For roughly 800 years, "legislation" largely meant special legislation: narrow bills tailored to the demands of particular persons, firms, or property. General laws were greeted with suspicion. Today, the reverse is true: it is believed that laws, to be good, must be broad, and states have overwhelmingly banned special bills. This article reconceives of this history, understanding special legislation and the modern administrative state as substitutes. It argues that, contrary to the accompanying anti-corruption rhetoric, the refashioning of legislation as it had always existed was born of politicians' desire to create and extract rents made possible by the 19th-century transportation boom. The emergence of the administrative state and the growth of American state capacity are thus understood as the endogenous fruits of industrialization. </p>
