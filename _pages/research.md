<div id="jmp" style="display:none;">
  <p>Rather than govern from a fixed capital, medieval European kings were itinerant. Itinerant kingship was a rational coalition-building strategy employed by relatively weak rulers in the face of potentially violent elites. To empirically explore itinerant kingship, I introduce data on the daily location of the English king from 1199 to 1547. Utilizing genealogical data for feudal barons and the timing of contested elections for bishops, I show that the king's itinerary targeted "key players" within the elite network to maintain political support. When the Early Modern "military revolution" increased the military power of the king vis-à-vis the elites, European kings adopted stationary governments.</p>

<div id="special-legislation" style="display:none;">
  <p>For roughly 800 years, "legislation" largely meant special legislation: narrow bills tailored to the demands of particular persons, firms, or property. General laws were greeted with suspicion. Today, the reverse is true: it is believed that laws, to be good, must be broad, and states have overwhelmingly banned special bills. This article reconceives of this history, understanding special legislation and the modern administrative state as substitutes. It argues that, contrary to the accompanying anti-corruption rhetoric, the refashioning of legislation as it had always existed was born of politicians' desire to create and extract rents made possible by the 19th-century transportation boom. The emergence of the administrative state and the growth of American state capacity are thus understood as the endogenous fruits of industrialization.</p>

**Islam, Trade, and the Rise of Northwestern Europe**\\
(with [Marcus Shera](https://www.marcusshera.com))

<button id="islam-trade-button" class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract('islam-trade')">Show Abstract</button>
<div id="islam-trade" style="display:none;">
  <p>The expansion of the Islamic Caliphate in the seventh century cut many European cities off from their trade partners in the Middle East and North Africa and ultimately redirected Mediterranean trade away from Western Europe. Taking a “market access” approach and by employing difference-in-differences empirical strategy, we show that the Islamic trade shock altered the spatial equilibrium of European urbanization in favor of northern Europe. We provide quantitative evidence for the validity, on some margins, of the often-debated “Pirenne Thesis.”</p>
