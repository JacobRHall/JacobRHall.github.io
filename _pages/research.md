  <summary>Itinerant Kings</summary>
  <p> <strong>Abstract:</strong>  Rather than govern from a fixed capital, medieval European kings were itinerant. I argue that itinerant kingship was a rational coalition-building strategy employed by relatively weak rulers in the face of potentially violent elites. To empirically explore itinerant kingship, I introduce data on the daily location of the English king from 1199 to 1547. Utilizing genealogical data for feudal barons, I show that the king's itinerary targeted “key players” within the elite network to maintain political support. When the Early Modern “military revolution” increased the military power of the king vis-à-vis the elites, European kings adopted stationary governments. </p>

  <summary>Magna Carta</summary>
  <p>(with <a href="https://mason.gmu.edu/~mkoyama2/About.html">Mark Koyama</a> and <a href="https://desireedesierto.com">Desiree Desierto</a>)</p>
  <p> <strong>Abstract:</strong>  Magna Carta, a pivotal moment in history, institutionalized constraints on royal power. As an ideal, Magna Carta prescribes an ‘inclusive’ power-sharing arrangement in which the ruler (king) has limited power and elites (barons) have equal rights. It was forged in a feudal environment and fought between a coalition of the king’s loyal barons and a coalition of rebel barons. We derive conditions under which Magna Carta occurs in equilibrium: when the king is extractive; when the initial distribution of power among barons is egalitarian; and when barons have large resources that cannot be easily appropriated by the king. Under these conditions, even the most powerful baron would be willing to change the status quo by leading a rebel coalition to fight for Magna Carta. To provide empirical support, we build a unique dataset of the universe of English barons, their family networks, and their baronies and resources between 1200-1270. </p>

  <summary>Railroads and American Institutional Change</summary>
  <p>(with <a href="https://slademendenhall.com">Slade Mendenhall</a>)</p>
  <p> <strong>Abstract:</strong>  For roughly 800 years, "legislation" largely meant special legislation: narrow bills tailored to the demands of particular persons, firms, or property. General laws were greeted with suspicion. Today, the reverse is true: it is believed that laws, to be good, must be broad, and states have overwhelmingly banned special bills. This article reconceives of this history, understanding special legislation and the modern administrative state as substitutes. It argues that, contrary to the accompanying anti-corruption rhetoric, the refashioning of legislation as it had always existed was born of politicians' desire to create and extract rents made possible by the 19th-century transportation boom. The emergence of the administrative state and the growth of American state capacity are thus understood as the endogenous fruits of industrialization. </p>

  <summary>The King's French: The Political Economy of Language</summary>
  <p>(with <a href="https://alexntaylor.github.io">Alexander Taylor</a>)</p>
  <p> <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper investigates the impact of language mandates on linguistic transition, standardization, and national identity in Early Modern France. Using the Universal Short Title Catalogue, we construct a panel of printing activity in European towns from 1500 to 1650. We then estimate the impact of the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts, an ordinance requiring the use of French, as opposed to Latin, in all legal documents, on vernacular language printing in France using a difference-in-discontinuities design. To account for the influence of religion on vernacular printing, we leverage a Large Language Model to classify selected authors from the time period as Protestant or Catholic and control for religious print output. Results suggest that the ordinance promoted the general use of vernacular language in print and led to an explosion of vernacular printing within France. We also study the impact of the ordinance on linguistic standardization, finding that the ordinance homogenized printed French to Parisian French standards, but only within France. To explore the long-run effects of language promotion and standardization on national identity, we estimate the impact of the ordinance on expressions of nationalism in the Cahiers de Doleances —a collection of grievances and suggestions filed by the three Estates on the eve of the French Revolution—finding more expressions of nationalism in Third Estate cahiers from print towns originally subjected to the ordinance. The findings have implications for the role of the state in shaping national identity, the legibility of the law, and the spread of ideas through language policy.

  <summary>
    <span>Travel Speed over the <em>Longue Durée</em></span><br>
    <span><em>European Review of Economic History</em>, forthcoming.</span>
  </summary>
  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In the premodern world, slow travel speed increased a ruler's governance costs and acted as a barrier to trade. But current estimates of medieval European travel speed are sparse, and the estimates that do exist rely on parsimonious data. Using the daily travel itineraries of medieval kings, I create near-continuous time series of travel speed along roads in England and France over four centuries. Average travel speed along the Medieval roads is estimated to be around 15 to 20 miles per day. Those average estimates remain fairly stable over the entire medieval period, although there is a great amount of heterogeneity at the journey level.</p>

    <span>Why Lords Went for Luxuries</span><br>
    <span><em>The Independent Review</em>, forthcoming.</span>
  </summary>
  <p>(with <a href="https://econfaculty.gmu.edu/klein/">Daniel B. Klein</a>)</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In Smith’s Wealth of Nations telling of political evolution 1400–1700, he leaves us wondering why lords went for luxuries. They bartered away their armies and power. Drawing on Smith’s Lectures on Jurisprudence, we explain why lords went for luxuries. The center, led by the king and his ministers, fostered new ways for a baron to signal his wealth and value as an ally. A diamond buckle signaled wealth, as did a retinue of 1000 men. But the baron could not bring 1000 rustics along to the pageant, for he alone had been invited. Instead, he brought bling. This explanation, implicating government and politics in the vanity and fetishization of bling, is hinted at in The Wealth of Nations when Smith writes cryptically of “the judges that were to determine the preference.” </p>
